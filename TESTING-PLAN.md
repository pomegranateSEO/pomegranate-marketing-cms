# Pomegranate CMS - UI/UX Testing Plan

**Companion to:** `IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md`
**Purpose:** Static code audits for each implementation checkpoint. Test agents read source files — they do NOT run a browser.
**Last Updated:** 2026-03-16
**Last Audit:** 2026-03-16 — T1 and T2 PASSED

---

## How to Use This Plan

**For the human:**
When you see a `🧪 TEST CHECKPOINT` block in `IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md`, that is your cue to spin up a test agent. Give it this prompt:

```
You are a code auditor for the Pomegranate Marketing CMS at C:\Users\k_che\Documents\pomegranate-marketing-cms.
Read CLAUDE.md for project context, then execute Test Suite [T1/T2/T3/T4] from TESTING-PLAN.md.
For each check, read the relevant source files and report PASS, FAIL, or WARN with file:line references.
Do NOT modify any files. Output a structured report only.
```

**For test agents:**
- Read source files directly — do not run `npm run dev` or open a browser
- Report each check as `PASS`, `FAIL`, or `WARN`
- For FAILs, include the file path and line number
- At the end, give a summary: total checks, passes, fails, warns

## Test Suite T1 — Toast Notification System

**Run after:** Task 1.1 is merged
**Checks:** 12

### T1.1 — sonner installed
- Read `package.json`
- PASS if `"sonner"` appears in `dependencies`

### T1.2 — toast utility exists
- Read `lib/toast.ts`
- PASS if file exists and exports a `toast` object with `success`, `error`, `info`, `warning`, `loading`, `dismiss` methods
- PASS if `success` uses `duration: 4000` and `error` uses `duration: 6000`

### T1.3 — Toaster mounted in App.tsx
- Read `App.tsx`
- PASS if `<Toaster` is rendered with `position="top-right"`, `richColors`, and `closeButton`

### T1.4 — No alert() calls remain in source
- Grep all `*.tsx` and `*.ts` files for `alert(`
- PASS if zero results
- FAIL and list every file:line if any remain

### T1.5 — Toast import present in all modified pages
Check that `import { toast } from` exists in each of these files:

- `components/forms/business/LocationSection.tsx`
- `components/forms/business/BrandSection.tsx`
- PASS if all files contain the import
- FAIL and list missing files if any do not

### T1.6 — Raw DB errors not exposed in toast messages
- Read each page file listed in T1.5
- WARN if any `toast.error()` call passes raw DB error text directly as the *title* (first argument) e.g. `toast.error(err.message)` — the message should be human-readable and the raw error should be the *description* (second argument) at most
- PASS if raw errors are only passed as the description argument or logged to console only

### T1.7 — Success toasts used for positive outcomes
- Read businesses, downloads, locations, knowledge-entities pages
- PASS if `toast.success(` is called after successful save/upload/sync operations (not `toast.error` or `toast.info`)

### T1.8 — TypeScript build passes
- Check that `npm run build` would succeed by verifying the dist output exists, OR
- Read the most recent git commit message to confirm build was verified before merge
- PASS if build was confirmed clean

### T1.9 — toast.warning used for validation nudges (not toast.error)
- Read `components/forms/LocationForm.tsx`, `components/editors/PseoPageEditor.tsx`, `components/forms/business/LocationSection.tsx`
- PASS if validation messages (e.g. "Please enter a location name first") use `toast.warning` not `toast.error`

### T1.10 — toast.info used for neutral informational messages
- Read `app/admin/knowledge-entities/page.tsx`
- PASS if "already in your Knowledge Graph" and "No entities found needing Wikidata URLs" use `toast.info`

### T1.11 — EntityGenerator shows success toast when entities added
- Read `components/shared/EntityGenerator.tsx`
- PASS if `toast.success(` is called when `added > 0`

### T1.12 — No window.confirm() calls remain (scope check only — full replacement is Task 1.5)
- Grep all `*.tsx` files for `window.confirm(` and bare `confirm(`
- This is an INFORMATIONAL check only — record how many remain for tracking purposes. Do NOT fail on this.
